# Expert System Project Using CLP
This is my final project for Expert System class with my friend. The project is built an application that can give an expert solution for helping Malone Delight. Malone Delights is a restaurant created by a fan of the series “The Office” which was built with the idea of one of the show’s character called Kevin Malone that spilled a pantry full of salsa on the office floor. The restaurant provides a variety of food which includes Mexican, Chinese, and Italian. The restaurant also opens a catering option for personal up to large scale purposes. The application that can give an expert solution for helping Malone Delights gets the feedback from customer and ease the process of managing the menu overall. This project is for Expert System class (Lab Class / COMP7066) from Binus University (Valid on Even Semester Year 2020/2021).
